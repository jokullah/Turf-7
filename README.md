# Football Career Simulator

A stochastic simulation of football player careers across European leagues, written as a Python learning project.

## Overview
Discrete event simulation modeling player career trajectories with:
- Probabilistic match outcomes and performance statistics
- Transfer dynamics based on player ability distributions
- Multi-tier league systems with promotion/relegation mechanics
- Career progression modeling with age-dependent ability curves

## Technical Components
- Gaussian distributions for player ability modeling
- Stochastic processes for match results and player development
- Hierarchical data structures for clubs, leagues, and competitions
- Statistical aggregation of career metrics

## Implementation Details
~3200 lines implementing match engines, transfer logic, and career tracking across 30+ leagues. Pulls real club/player name data from external sources for realistic simulation outputs.

**Context:** Early Python project from undergraduate studies, focused on learning language fundamentals through a complex simulation problem.
